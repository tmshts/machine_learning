As a part of a course Machine Learning at the Universit√† della Svizzera italiana (USI) in Lugano we could have delivered 2 projects voluntarily. Therefore, I delivered these projects based on the assignments.

  <li>project was focused on linear and non-linear regression problem and their comparison.</li>
  <li>project was about Convolutional Neural Network, Feed Forward Neural Network and
their comparisson based on the accuracy measurement.</li>
</ol>
